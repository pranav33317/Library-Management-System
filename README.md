Instructions
Develop a Library Management System application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Make appropriate classes that represent different entities and functionalities within the library system.
Design a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the library system.
Ensure that your code works for all possible scenarios.
If the code does not compile using Maven, you will get a zero.

Implement a library system for IIITD. You can use the interface either as a librarian or as a student. A librarian manages members/students and books of the library. A librarian can view, register or remove members. They can also view books, add a book, remove a book, issue a book and collect dues/fines. The fine is applied as 3 rupees per day post the return due date of a book. Assume the due date for all books to be 10 days after the issue date. If a member is returning a book after the due date, the book will be returned and a balance will be due on the member. Before issuing a new book the balance should be paid by the member to the librarian. A member can view all available books, borrow a book, return a book, view their own books, and pay dues.There may be multiple copies of a single book. A member can only borrow a book if there is an available copy of the book which is not issued. A member can hold at most 2 books at a time. 

Functionalities:
1. Add Book:
   Allow a librarian to add a new book to the library.
   Take input for book details (title, author, total copies).

2. Remove Book:
Allow a librarian to remove a book from the library.
Take input for book ID.

3. Register Member:
Allow a librarian to add a new member to the library.
Take input for member details (name, age, etc). 
The Phone Number can act as an unique input to identify the members uniquely.

4. Remove Member:
    Allow a librarian to remove a member from the library.
   Take input for member ID. Here also, we can take input as username and phone no etc. 

5. Enter as a member 
Takes the member name and phone number as input and logs in as the particular member, if already registered . 
If not registered, gives an error message. 

6. Issue Book:
   Allow a member to borrow a book from the library, given his penalty amount is zero. If he owes the library penalty money, he should first clear that before issuing a new book. 
   Display available books and take input for book ID.

7. Return Book:
   Allow a member to return a borrowed book.
   Display borrowed books and take input for book ID.

8. List Books:
   Display a list of all available books in the library.

9. List Members:
   Display a list of all registered members of the library.

10. Calculate Fine:
    Calculate and display the fine amount for a book if it's returned after the due date (10 days). Here for ease of testing, take 1 sec = 1 day. 

11. Exit:
     Terminate the application.

Guidelines:
Implement input validation to handle incorrect or invalid user inputs.
Ensure proper error handling and display user-friendly error messages.
Apply OOP principles to improve code organization and readability.
